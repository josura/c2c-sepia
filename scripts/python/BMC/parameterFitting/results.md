## SIS model
For the graph of erdos-Renyi, the best fit for the SIS model seems to be:
1. **0.2 scaled dissipation** and **2.0 scaled propagation**, LSE = 211061484.0
2. **0.75 scaled dissipation** and **16.0 scaled propagation**,LSE = 108083723.0
3. **0.72 scaled dissipation** and **14.0 scaled propagation**,LSE = 94911682.0 (scaled time gives better result, scaling of 0.35)
